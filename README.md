## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how advanced, automated trading systems are built in the cryptocurrency space.

Let's break down how a sidechain architecture integrates with major exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: The Problem Sidechains Solve

First, understand the core problem: **You cannot run complex, automated trading logic directly on a main blockchain like Ethereum or Bitcoin.** It would be far too slow and expensive due to network congestion and gas fees.

A **sidechain** is a separate blockchain that runs parallel to a main blockchain (the "mainnet") and is connected to it by a two-way peg. This allows assets to be moved securely between the mainnet and the sidechain.

In the context of trading, the sidechain becomes a **high-performance, low-cost execution environment** where the heavy lifting of trading strategy logic, portfolio rebalancing, and data analysis happens. The mainnet is primarily used for the secure, final settlement of funds.
